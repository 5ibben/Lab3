-----------What did you learn? What did you know already?-----------

I learned a bit about pointers, more specifically I learned about the use of pointers. 
I find it much more difficult in practise, then in theory. 
I feel I need some more practise to feel completely comfortable in how to use them properly, but this was a good step on the way.

I learned a little bit about file IO, and was pleasantly surprised at the ease of implementing it.

I also find that the repetiton of doing stuff you already "know" is very valuable in itself, 
not only to solidify what you already know, but to expand on that knowledge.


-----------What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?-----------

I had some syntactic problems with pointers in general, due to a lack of knowledge.
I found task 2 to be the most difficult, probably due to the use of "doubble pointers".


-----------How can the lab be improved?-----------

I don´t wanna sound like a broken record, overall it was preyy good.


-----------Additionally, write an estimate how many hours you spent on this lab.-----------

6~7
